# Formalization project for Logika v Računalništvu

This is the repository for the formalization project for Logic in Computer science (group: Luka Šešet and Tia Krofel).

Our solutions are presented in the *projectLOGRAC.lean* file as follows:

- First small task (formalization of the recursive definition of the catalan numbers);
- Second small task (formalization of the concept of plane trees);
- Third small task (formalization of the concept of full binary trees);
- Fourth small task (construction of the type of full binary trees with *n* nodes, not counting the leaves);
- Fifth small task (definition of the type of ballot sequences of length *n*);
- Fourth large task (construction of a bijection between list plane trees and plane trees);
- Fifth large task (construction of the rotating isomorphism (the isomorphism between plane trees and full binary trees)).
- Sixth large task (proving that *Binom(2n, n)* is divisible by *n+1*).
